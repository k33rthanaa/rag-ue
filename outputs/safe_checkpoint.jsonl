Luis N. Rivera-Pagán holds a Ph.D. in the history of theology from Yale University (1970).\n2. He was a Professor of Systematic Theology from 1970 to 2003.\n3. He is currently the Henry Winters Luce Professor of Ecumenics Emeritus at Princeton Theological Seminary.\n4. He gave an inaugural lecture on April 9, 2003, at Princeton Theological Seminary.\n5. He has been involved in drafting historical texts and theological treatises.\n6. He is mentioned as the Henry Winters Luce Professor in Ecumenics and Mission.\n7. There is a repeated mention of his role and contributions, but the exact date of his appointment to the Henry Winters Luce Professor of Ecumenics is not explicitly stated.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Professor of Systematic Theology (1970-2003)**: The KNOWLEDGE states that Rivera-Pagán was a Professor of Systematic Theology from 1970 to 2003. This indicates that he held a teaching position during this period, but it does not specify the exact date when he transitioned to his role as the Henry Winters Luce Professor of Ecumenics.\n\n2. **Henry Winters Luce Professor Emeritus**: The KNOWLEDGE mentions that Rivera-Pagán is currently the Henry Winters Luce Professor of Ecumenics Emeritus. This indicates that he held this position at some point, but it does not specify when he was appointed to this role.\n\n3. **Inaugural Lecture (2003)**: The KNOWLEDGE notes that Rivera-Pagán gave an inaugural lecture on April 9, 2003. This could suggest that this was a significant event, possibly marking the start of his tenure as the Henry Winters Luce Professor of Ecumenics. However, this is not explicitly stated.\n\n4. **Missing Appointment Details**: The KNOWLEDGE mentions that information about Rivera-Pagán's appointment is missing. This suggests that the exact date of his appointment to the Henry Winters Luce Professor of Ecumenics is not provided in the KNOWLEDGE.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the KNOWLEDGE strongly suggests that Luis Nicolás Rivera-Pagán held the position of Henry Winters Luce Professor of Ecumenics at Princeton Theological Seminary, it does not explicitly state that he was appointed to this position in 2003.

Born to a Kakwa father and a Lugbara mother, either in Koboko or Kampala around 1925, Amin joined the King's African Rifles (KAR) of the British Colonial Army in 1946. He rose through the ranks, initially serving as a cook before becoming a lieutenant and participating in British military actions. Amin's rule was marked by severe human rights abuses, political repression, and economic mismanagement. He expelled Ugandan Asians and nationalized British-owned businesses, leading to strained international relations, particularly with India, the UK, and Israel. In 1972, he broke diplomatic ties with the UK and Israel, turning to Muammar Gaddafi and the Soviet Union for support. Amin's regime was characterized by widespread violence and is estimated to have resulted in the deaths of between 100,000 and 500,000 people. In 1978, after attempting to annex Tanzania's Kagera Region, Amin faced a joint Ugandan-Tanzanian invasion that led to his overthrow in 1979.

Himmler rose to prominence within the Nazi Party, becoming the \"Reichsführer-SS\" and one of the most powerful figures under Adolf Hitler.

On 23 May 1945, Himmler was captured by British forces and taken to the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg.

Ghosn has held several high-profile positions in the automotive industry, including CEO of Michelin North America, chairman and CEO of Renault, chairman of AvtoVAZ, chairman and former CEO of Nissan, and chairman of Mitsubishi Motors. He was also the chairman and CEO of the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, a strategic partnership between these automotive manufacturers. Ghosn's career is marked by significant achievements, such as his successful restructuring of Renault and Nissan, which earned him celebrity status in Japan and the business world. He was named a \"Super Leader\" in 2004 and 2005 and was the subject of a Japanese manga comic book. In 2016, Nissan acquired a controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors, and Ghosn took on the role of chairman to rehabilitate the company. However, his career took a dramatic turn in 2018 when he was arrested for under-reporting his earnings and misuse of company assets, leading to his dismissal as Nissan's chairman.

He was selected as part of the third group of fourteen astronauts in 1963. Collins flew into space twice, first on Gemini 10, where he and Command Pilot John Young performed two rendezvous with different spacecraft and undertook two extra-vehicular activities (EVAs, also known as spacewalks). His second spaceflight was on Apollo 11, where he served as the Command Module Pilot, orbiting the Moon while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made the first manned landing on its surface. Collins is one of 24 people to have flown to the Moon and the fourth person, and third American, to perform an EVA.\n\nAfter his astronaut career, Collins attained the rank of major general in the U.S. Air Force Reserves and retired in 1982. He was appointed director of the National Air and Space Museum in 1971, a position he held until 1978, and later became undersecretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Collins completed the Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program in 1974 and served as Vice President of LTV Aerospace in Arlington, Virginia, from 1980.

Born to Cornish parents in Barnstaple, Devon, England, Vickery began his rugby career at a young age, gaining his first National Representative honour at 16 when he was picked for the England Schools U16s group. He played for Gloucester Rugby for 11 years before signing a three-year deal with Wasps in 2006. Vickery made his England debut against Wales in 1998 and was part of the 2003 World Cup-winning squad, playing in all seven matches and captaining the side against Uruguay. He scored his first international try against Samoa in the same tournament. In 2001, he toured Australia with the British and Irish Lions, playing in all three tests. Vickery captained England during the 2007 Six Nations and the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He was selected for the 2008 Six Nations but missed the match against Italy due to injury. After a successful career, Vickery was forced to retire in 2010 due to neck injuries. He later joined Worcester Warriors as an Assistant Forwards (Scrum) coach in 2012 but left after an unsuccessful season.

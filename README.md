# RAG-Uncertainty-Estimator
This project aims to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with Uncertainty Estimation (UE). It will use Contriever for retrieval, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct for generation, and MARS &amp; Eccentricity for UE. The goal is to improve response accuracy using large-scale datasets like FactScore-Bio and LongFact-Objects.
